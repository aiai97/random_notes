# random_notes
I am recording my daily learning. 
Since my crush said that I need to stay focused,I will learn software development this year and next year.
Hopefully,when I am boring,I will be doing leetcode and system design every day.
He always told me to make some friends in real life but I don't trust people at most times.I am a home person.
I feel regretful because when I was bad in programming,I can amend my knowledge network again and again while I cannot
amend someone's broken heart.
I do learn a profound lesson that is,emmmm,bf or husband is much much more important than learning coding although I keep coding every day.
I read some notes and people say that I need to show my initiative to be independent.
要是学习跟写日记一样简单，我肯定学得可好了。
