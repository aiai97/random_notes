I am recording my daily learning. I bet I am not that patient as most science students.And I am careless who will lose
keys at times.I bet I resemble a robot in my daily life which makes sense that my programmer friends are always 
agonized by my meanlingless conversations.
I don't like programming but I am fascinated with smart people.And whenever I have bugs,it is a nightmare for me.
I wish one day I can learn robots or deep learning and some arcane artificial intelligence papers.
I learn software development and artificial intelligence at the same time but maybe this year I am busy with learning
doing leetcode or system design problems.
