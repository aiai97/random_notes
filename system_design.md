Performance is the degree to which a software system or component meets its objectives for timeliness.
Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth
Vertical scaling refers to the approach of scaling a system by adding resources (memory, CPU, disk, etc.) to a single node. Meanwhile, horizontal scaling refers to the approach of scaling by adding more nodes to the system.
In the context of software systems, availability is the probability of a system to work as required, when required, during a mission.
Redundancy is one of the widely used mechanisms to achieve higher availability. It refers to storing data into multiple, redundant computers
The difference in developing software for distributed systems
Fallacies
The network is reliable
Latency is zero
Bandwidth is infinite
The network is secure
Topology doesnâ€™t change
Transport cost is zero
