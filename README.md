# random_notes
I am recording my daily learning.
I don't like the way of doubting friendship.
I prefer to being a simple myself.I bet I am a simple person too.
Sometimes when I look in the mirror,I hate my current appearance and the black cycles are so obvious.
I can't be as cute as I used to be.
Everytime when I am down,I am coding or eating.
Sometimes I hate programming coz it costs me a lot of patience.I have treated a guy as I do to coding.
Sometimes I like it coz it is not that difficult as they say.
